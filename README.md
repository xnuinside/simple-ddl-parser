## Simple DDL Parser

![badge1](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/simple-ddl-parser) ![badge2](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/simple-ddl-parser) ![badge3](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/simple-ddl-parser) ![workflow](https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Build with ply (lex & yacc in python). A lot of samples in 'tests/.

### Is it Stable?

Yes, library already has about 9000+ downloads per day  - https://pypistats.org/packages/simple-ddl-parser..

As maintainer, I guarantee that any backward incompatible changes will not be done in patch or minor version. But! Pay attention that sometimes output in keywords can be changed in minor version because of fixing wrong behaviour in past.

### Articles with examples

1. SQL Diagram (Part 3): SQL-to-ERD with DDL: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/sql-diagram-part-3-sql-to-erd-with-ddl-4c9840ee86c3 

### Updates in version 1.x

The full list of updates can be found in the Changelog below (at the end of README).

Version 1.0.0 was released due to significant changes in the output structure and a stricter approach regarding the scope of the produced output. Now, you must provide the argument 'output_mode=name_of_your_dialect' if you wish to see arguments/properties specific to a particular dialect


### How does it work?

Parser supports: 

- SQL
- HQL (Hive)
- MSSQL dialec
- Oracle dialect
- MySQL dialect
- PostgreSQL dialect
- BigQuery
- Redshift
- Snowflake
- SparkSQL
- IBM DB2 dialect

You can check dialects sections after `Supported Statements` section to get more information that statements from dialects already supported by parser. If you need to add more statements or new dialects - feel free to open the issue. 


### Feel free to open Issue with DDL sample
Pay attentions that I'm adding functional tests for all supported statement, so if you see that your statement is failed and you didn't see it in the test 99,9% that I did n't have sample with such SQL statement - so feel free to open the issue and I will add support for it. 

**If you need some statement, that not supported by parser yet**: please provide DDL example & information about that is it SQL dialect or DB.

Types that are used in your DB does not matter, so parser must also work successfully to any DDL for SQL DB. Parser is NOT case sensitive, it did not expect that all queries will be in upper case or lower case. So you can write statements like this:

```sql

    Alter Table Persons ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_PersonAge CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes');

```

It will be parsed as is without errors.

If you have samples that cause an error - please open the issue (but don't forget to add ddl example), I will be glad to fix it.

A lot of statements and output result you can find in tests on the github - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/tree/main/tests .

### How to install

```bash

    pip install simple-ddl-parser

```

## How to use

### Extract additional information from HQL (& other dialects)

In some dialects like HQL there is a lot of additional information about table like, fore example, is it external table, STORED AS, location & etc. This property will be always empty in 'classic' SQL DB like PostgreSQL or MySQL and this is the reason, why by default this information are 'hidden'.
Also some fields hidden in HQL, because they are simple not exists in HIVE, for example 'deferrable_initially'
To get this 'hql' specific details about table in output please use 'output_mode' argument in run() method.

example:

```python

    ddl = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.salesorderdetail(
        SalesOrderID int,
        ProductID int,
        OrderQty int,
        LineTotal decimal
        )
    PARTITIONED BY (batch_id int, batch_id2 string, batch_32 some_type)
    LOCATION 's3://datalake/table_name/v1'
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
        COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY '\002'
        MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY '\003'
    STORED AS TEXTFILE
    """

    result = DDLParser(ddl).run(output_mode="hql")
    print(result)
```

And you will get output with additional keys 'stored_as', 'location', 'external', etc.

```python

    # additional keys examples
  {
    ...,
    'location': "'s3://datalake/table_name/v1'",
    'map_keys_terminated_by': "'\\003'",
    'partitioned_by': [{'name': 'batch_id', 'size': None, 'type': 'int'},
                        {'name': 'batch_id2', 'size': None, 'type': 'string'},
                        {'name': 'batch_32', 'size': None, 'type': 'some_type'}],
    'primary_key': [],
    'row_format': 'DELIMITED',
    'schema': 'default',
    'stored_as': 'TEXTFILE',
    ... 
  }

```

If you run parser with command line add flag '-o=hql' or '--output-mode=hql' to get the same result.

Possible output_modes: ['redshift', 'spark_sql', 'mysql', 'bigquery', 'mssql', 'databricks', 'sqlite', 'vertics', 'ibm_db2', 'postgres', 'oracle', 'hql', 'snowflake', 'sql']

### From python code

```python
    from simple_ddl_parser import DDLParser


    parse_results = DDLParser("""create table dev.data_sync_history(
        data_sync_id bigint not null,
        sync_count bigint not null,
        sync_mark timestamp  not  null,
        sync_start timestamp  not null,
        sync_end timestamp  not null,
        message varchar(2000) null,
        primary key (data_sync_id, sync_start)
    ); """).run()

    print(parse_results) 

```

### To parse from file

```python
    
    from simple_ddl_parser import parse_from_file

    result = parse_from_file('tests/sql/test_one_statement.sql')
    print(result)

```

### From command line

simple-ddl-parser is installed to environment as command **sdp**

```bash

    sdp path_to_ddl_file

    # for example:

    sdp tests/sql/test_two_tables.sql
    
```

You will see the output in **schemas** folder in file with name **test_two_tables_schema.json**

If you want to have also output in console - use **-v** flag for verbose.

```bash
    
    sdp tests/sql/test_two_tables.sql -v
    
```

If you don't want to dump schema in file and just print result to the console, use **--no-dump** flag:


```bash
    
    sdp tests/sql/test_two_tables.sql --no-dump
    
```

You can provide target path where you want to dump result with argument **-t**, **--target**:


```bash
    
    sdp tests/sql/test_two_tables.sql -t dump_results/
    
```
### Get Output in JSON

If you want to get output in JSON in stdout you can use argument **json_dump=True** in method **.run()** for this
```python
    from simple_ddl_parser import DDLParser


    parse_results = DDLParser("""create table dev.data_sync_history(
        data_sync_id bigint not null,
        sync_count bigint not null,
    ); """).run(json_dump=True)

    print(parse_results) 

```
Output will be:

```json
[{"columns": [{"name": "data_sync_id", "type": "bigint", "size": null, "references": null, "unique": false, "nullable": false, "default": null, "check": null}, {"name": "sync_count", "type": "bigint", "size": null, "references": null, "unique": false, "nullable": false, "default": null, "check": null}], "primary_key": [], "alter": {}, "checks": [], "index": [], "partitioned_by": [], "tablespace": null, "schema": "dev", "table_name": "data_sync_history"}]
```

### More details

`DDLParser(ddl).run()`
.run() method contains several arguments, that impact changing output result. As you can saw upper exists argument `output_mode` that allow you to set dialect and get more fields in output relative to chosen dialect, for example 'hql'. Possible output_modes: ['redshift', 'spark_sql', 'mysql', 'bigquery', 'mssql', 'databricks', 'sqlite', 'vertics', 'ibm_db2', 'postgres', 'oracle', 'hql', 'snowflake', 'sql']

Also in .run() method exists argument `group_by_type` (by default: False). By default output of parser looks like a List with Dicts where each dict == one entity from ddl (table, sequence, type, etc). And to understand that is current entity you need to check Dict like: if 'table_name' in dict - this is a table, if 'type_name' - this is a type & etc.

To make work little bit easy you can set group_by_type=True and you will get output already sorted by types, like:

```python

    { 
        'tables': [all_pasrsed_tables], 
        'sequences': [all_pasrsed_sequences], 
        'types': [all_pasrsed_types], 
        'domains': [all_pasrsed_domains],
        ...
    }

```

For example:

```python

    ddl = """
    CREATE TYPE "schema--notification"."ContentType" AS
        ENUM ('TEXT','MARKDOWN','HTML');
        CREATE TABLE "schema--notification"."notification" (
            content_type "schema--notification"."ContentType"
        );
    CREATE SEQUENCE dev.incremental_ids
        INCREMENT 10
        START 0
        MINVALUE 0
        MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807
        CACHE 1;
    """

    result = DDLParser(ddl).run(group_by_type=True)

    # result will be:

    {'sequences': [{'cache': 1,
                    'increment': 10,
                    'maxvalue': 9223372036854775807,
                    'minvalue': 0,
                    'schema': 'dev',
                    'sequence_name': 'incremental_ids',
                    'start': 0}],
    'tables': [{'alter': {},
                'checks': [],
                'columns': [{'check': None,
                            'default': None,
                            'name': 'content_type',
                            'nullable': True,
                            'references': None,
                            'size': None,
                            'type': '"schema--notification"."ContentType"',
                            'unique': False}],
                'index': [],
                'partitioned_by': [],
                'primary_key': [],
                'schema': '"schema--notification"',
                'table_name': '"notification"'}],
    'types': [{'base_type': 'ENUM',
                'properties': {'values': ["'TEXT'", "'MARKDOWN'", "'HTML'"]},
                'schema': '"schema--notification"',
                'type_name': '"ContentType"'}]}

```

### ALTER statements

Right now added support only for ALTER statements with FOREIGEIN key

For example, if in your ddl after table definitions (create table statements) you have ALTER table statements like this:

```sql

ALTER TABLE "material_attachments" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("material_id", "material_title") REFERENCES "materials" ("id", "title");

```

This statements will be parsed and information about them putted inside 'alter' key in table's dict.
For example, please check alter statement tests - **tests/test_alter_statements.py**


### More examples & tests

You can find in **tests/** folder.

### Dump result in json

To dump result in json use argument .run(dump=True)

You also can provide a path where you want to have a dumps with schema with argument .run(dump_path='folder_that_use_for_dumps/')


### Raise error if DDL cannot be parsed by Parser

By default Parser does not raise the error if some statement cannot be parsed - and just skip & produce empty output.

To change this behavior you can pass 'silent=False' argumen to main parser class, like:

    DDLParser(.., silent=False)

### Normalize names

Use DDLParser(.., normalize_names=True)flag that change output of parser:
If flag is True (default 'False') then all identifiers will be returned without '[', '"' and other delimiters that used in different SQL dialects to separate custom names from reserved words & statements.
For example, if flag set 'True' and you pass this input: 

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TO_Requests](
    [Request_ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [user_id] [int]

In output you will have names like 'dbo' and 'TO_Requests', not '[dbo]' and '[TO_Requests]'.

#### Logging

1. Logging to file

To get logging output to file you should provide to Parser 'log_file' argument with path or file name:

```console

    DDLParser(ddl, log_file='parser221.log').run(group_by_type=True)

```

2. Logging level

To set logging level you should provide argument 'log_level'

```console

    DDLParser(ddl, log_level=logging.INFO).run(group_by_type=True)

```

## Changelog
**v1.6.1**
### Fixes
1. #289 CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS plus comment fail
2. schema or db.schema location in snowflake

**v1.6.0**
### IMPORTANT:
In this versions there is some output changes & fixes that can break your code.
1. Now all arguments inside brackets are parsed as separate strings in the list.
For example:
 `file_format = (TYPE=JSON NULL_IF=('field')` this was parsed like 'NULL_IF': "('field')",
 now it will be: 'NULL_IF': ["'field'"],

2. Added separate tokens for EQ `=` and IN (previously they was parsed as IDs also - for internal info, for contributors.

3. Some check statements in columns now parsed validly, also IN statements parsed as normal lists.
So this statement include_exclude_ind CHAR(1) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT chk_metalistcombo_logicalopr
  CHECK (include_exclude_ind IN ('I', 'E')),


will produce this output:

{'check': {'constraint_name': 'chk_metalistcombo_logicalopr',
                         'statement': {'in_statement': {'in': ["'I'", "'E'"],
                                                        'name': 'include_exclude_ind'}}},

**v1.0.0**
In output structure was done important changes that can in theory breaks code.

### Important changes
1. Important change: 

all custom table properties that are defined after column definition in 'CREATE TABLE' statement and relative to only one dialect (only for SparkSQL, or HQL,etc), for example, like here:
https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/blob/main/tests/dialects/test_snowflake.py#L767  or https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/blob/main/tests/dialects/test_spark_sql.py#L133 will be saved now in property `table_properties` as dict.
Previously they was placed on same level of table output as `columns`, `alter`, etc. Now, they grouped and moved to key `table_properties`.

2. Formatting parser result now represented by 2 classes - Output & TableData, that makes it more strict and readable.

3. The output mode now functions more strictly. If you want to obtain output fields specific to a certain dialect, 
use output_mode='snowflake' for Snowflake or output_mode='hql' for HQL, etc. 
Previously, some keys appeared in the result without being filtered by dialect. 
For example, if 'CLUSTER BY' was in the DDL, it would show up in the 'cluster_by' field regardless of the output mode. 
However, now all fields that only work in certain dialects and are not part of the basic SQL notation will only be shown 
if you choose the correct output_mode.


### New Dialects support
1. Added as possible output_modes new Dialects: 
- Databricks SQL like 'databricks', 
- Vertica as 'vertica', 
- SqliteFields as 'sqlite',
- PostgreSQL as 'postgres'

Full list of supported dialects you can find in dict - `supported_dialects`:

`from simple_ddl_parser import supported_dialects`

Currently supported: ['redshift', 'spark_sql', 'mysql', 'bigquery', 'mssql', 'databricks', 'sqlite', 'vertics', 'ibm_db2', 'postgres', 'oracle', 'hql', 'snowflake', 'sql']

If you don't see dialect that you want to use - open issue with description and links to Database docs or use one of existed dialects.

### Snowflake updates:
1. For some reasons, 'CLONE' statement in SNOWFLAKE was parsed into 'like' key in output. Now it was changed to 'clone' - inner structure of output stay the same as previously.

### MySQL updates:
1. Engine statement now parsed correctly. Previously, output was always '='.

### BigQuery updates:
1. Word 'schema' totally removed from output. `Dataset` used instead of `schema` in BigQuery dialect.

**v0.32.1**
### Minor Fixes
1. Removed debug print

**v0.32.0**

### Improvements
1. Added support for several ALTER statements (ADD, DROP, RENAME, etc) - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/215
In 'alter' output added several keys:
    1. 'dropped_columns' - to store information about columns that was in table, but after dropped by alter
    2. 'renamed_columns' - to store information about columns that was renamed
    3. 'modified_columns' - to track alter column changes for defaults, datetype, etc. Argument stores previous columns states.

### Fixes
1. Include source column names in FOREIGN KEY references. Fix for: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/196
2. ALTER statement now will be parsed correctly if names & schemas written differently in `create table` statement and alter. 
For example, if in create table you use quotes like "schema_name"."table_name", but in alter was schema_name.table_name - previously it didn't work, but now parser understand that it is the same table.

**v0.28.1**
Improvements:
1. Lines started with INSERT INTO statement now successfully ignored by parser (so you can keep them in ddl - they will be just skipped)

Fixes:
1. Important fix for multiline comments


**v0.28.0**

Important Changes (Pay attention):
1. Because of parsing now AUTO_INCREMENT as a separate property of column previous output changed.
Previously it was parsed as a part of type like:  'INT AUTO_INCREMENT'.
Now type will be only 'INT', but in column property you will see 'autoincrement': True.

Amazing innovation:
1. It's is weird to write in Changelog, but only in version 0.28.0 I recognize that floats that not supported by parser & it was fixed.
Thanks for the sample in the issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/163

Improvements:
MariaDB:
1. Added support for MariaDB AUTO_INCREMENT (from ddl here - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/144)
If column is Auto Incremented - it indicated as 'autoincrement': True in column definition

Common:
1. Added parsing for multiline comments in DDL with `/* */` syntax.
2. Comments from DDL now all placed in 'comments' keyword if you use `group_by_type=` arg in parser.
3. Added argument 'parser_settings={}' (dict type) in method  parse_from_file() - this way you can pass any arguments that you want to DDLParser (& that supported by it)
So, if you want to set log_level=logging.WARNING for parser - just use it as:
parse_from_file('path_to_file', parser_settings={'log_level': logging.WARNING}). For issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/160

if flag is True (default 'False') then all identifiers will be returned without '[', '"' and other delimiters that used in different SQL dialects to separate custom names from reserved words & statements.
For example, if flag set 'True' and you pass this input:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TO_Requests](
    [Request_ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [user_id] [int]

In output you will have names like 'dbo' and 'TO_Requests', not '[dbo]' and '[TO_Requests]'.
