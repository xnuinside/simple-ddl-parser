## [1.6.0] - 2024-08-12
### Changed
In this versions there is some output changes & fixes that can break your code.
1. Now all arguments inside brackets are parsed as separate strings in the list.
For example:
 `file_format = (TYPE=JSON NULL_IF=('field')` this was parsed like 'NULL_IF': "('field')",
 now it will be: 'NULL_IF': ["'field'"],

2. Added separate tokens for EQ `=` and IN (previously they was parsed as IDs also - for internal info, for contributors.

3. Some check statements in columns now parsed validly, also IN statements parsed as normal lists.
So this statement include_exclude_ind CHAR(1) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT chk_metalistcombo_logicalopr
  CHECK (include_exclude_ind IN ('I', 'E')),


will produce this output:

{'check': {'constraint_name': 'chk_metalistcombo_logicalopr',
                         'statement': {'in_statement': {'in': ["'I'", "'E'"],
                                                        'name': 'include_exclude_ind'}}},

2. When using `normalize_names=True` ensure that `"complex"."type"` style names convert to `complex.type`.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-09
In output structure was done important changes that can in theory breaks code.

### Changed
1. Important change: 

all custom table properties that are defined after column definition in 'CREATE TABLE' statement and relative to only one dialect (only for SparkSQL, or HQL,etc), for example, like here:
https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/blob/main/tests/dialects/test_snowflake.py#L767  or https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/blob/main/tests/dialects/test_spark_sql.py#L133 will be saved now in property `table_properties` as dict.
Previously they was placed on same level of table output as `columns`, `alter`, etc. Now, they grouped and moved to key `table_properties`.

2. Formatting parser result now represented by 2 classes - Output & TableData, that makes it more strict and readable.

3. The output mode now functions more strictly. If you want to obtain output fields specific to a certain dialect, 
use output_mode='snowflake' for Snowflake or output_mode='hql' for HQL, etc. 
Previously, some keys appeared in the result without being filtered by dialect. 
For example, if 'CLUSTER BY' was in the DDL, it would show up in the 'cluster_by' field regardless of the output mode. 
However, now all fields that only work in certain dialects and are not part of the basic SQL notation will only be shown 
if you choose the correct output_mode.


### Added
1. Added as possible output_modes new Dialects: 
- Databricks SQL like 'databricks', 
- Vertica as 'vertica', 
- SqliteFields as 'sqlite',
- PostgreSQL as 'postgres'

Full list of supported dialects you can find in dict - `supported_dialects`:

`from simple_ddl_parser import supported_dialects`

Currently supported: ['redshift', 'spark_sql', 'mysql', 'bigquery', 'mssql', 'databricks', 'sqlite', 'vertics', 'ibm_db2', 'postgres', 'oracle', 'hql', 'snowflake', 'sql']

If you don't see dialect that you want to use - open issue with description and links to Database docs or use one of existed dialects.

### Changed
1. For some reasons, 'CLONE' statement in SNOWFLAKE was parsed into 'like' key in output. Now it was changed to 'clone' - inner structure of output stay the same as previously.

### Changed
1. Engine statement now parsed correctly. Previously, output was always '='.

### Changed
1. Word 'schema' totally removed from output. `Dataset` used instead of `schema` in BigQuery dialect.

## [0.32.1] - 2024-01-07
### Fixed
1. Removed debug print

## [0.32.0] - 2024-01-07

### Changed
1. Added support for several ALTER statements (ADD, DROP, RENAME, etc) - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/215
In 'alter' output added several keys:
    1. 'dropped_columns' - to store information about columns that was in table, but after dropped by alter
    2. 'renamed_columns' - to store information about columns that was renamed
    3. 'modified_columns' - to track alter column changes for defaults, datetype, etc. Argument stores previous columns states.

### Fixed
1. Include source column names in FOREIGN KEY references. Fix for: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/196
2. ALTER statement now will be parsed correctly if names & schemas written differently in `create table` statement and alter. 
For example, if in create table you use quotes like "schema_name"."table_name", but in alter was schema_name.table_name - previously it didn't work, but now parser understand that it is the same table.

## [0.31.3] - 2024-01-05
### Changed
#### Snowflake update:
1. Added support for Snowflake Virtual Column definition in External Column  `AS ()` statement - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/218
2. enforce support for Snowflake _FILE_FORMAT options in External Column ddl statement - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/221

#### Others
1. Support for KEY statement in CREATE TABLE statements. KEY statements will now create INDEX entries in the DDL parser.


## [0.31.2] - 2023-12-17
### Changed
#### Snowflake update:
1. Added support for Snowflake AUTOINCREMENT | IDENTITY column definitions with optional parameter `ORDER|NOORDER` statement - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/213

#### Common
1. Added param 'encoding' to parse_from_file function - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/142.

## [0.31.1] - 2023-11-05
### Changed
#### Snowflake update:
1. Support multiple tag definitions in a single `WITH TAG` statement.

Added support for ORGANIZE BY statement

2. Added support for PostgreSQL INHERITS statement. Issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/191

## [0.29.1] - 2023-01-07
### Changed
1. Python 3.6 is deprecated in tests and by default, try to move to Python3.7, but better to 3.8, because 3.7 will be deprecated in 2023.

### Fixed
1. Fix for https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/177

Fix for: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/170
2. Fix issue ' TypeError argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable' on some foreigen keys https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/148

### Added

1. Support for non-numeric column type parameters https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/171
It shows in column attribute 'type_parameters'.


## [0.28.1] - 2022-10-31
Improvements:
1. Lines started with INSERT INTO statement now successfully ignored by parser (so you can keep them in ddl - they will be just skipped)

Fixes:
1. Important fix for multiline comments


## [0.28.0] - 2022-10-30

Important Changes (Pay attention):
1. Because of parsing now AUTO_INCREMENT as a separate property of column previous output changed.
Previously it was parsed as a part of type like:  'INT AUTO_INCREMENT'.
Now type will be only 'INT', but in column property you will see 'autoincrement': True.

Amazing innovation:
1. It's is weird to write in Changelog, but only in version 0.28.0 I recognize that floats that not supported by parser & it was fixed.
Thanks for the sample in the issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/163

Improvements:
MariaDB:
1. Added support for MariaDB AUTO_INCREMENT (from ddl here - https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/144)
If column is Auto Incremented - it indicated as 'autoincrement': True in column definition

Common:
1. Added parsing for multiline comments in DDL with `/* */` syntax.
2. Comments from DDL now all placed in 'comments' keyword if you use `group_by_type=` arg in parser.
3. Added argument 'parser_settings={}' (dict type) in method  parse_from_file() - this way you can pass any arguments that you want to DDLParser (& that supported by it)
So, if you want to set log_level=logging.WARNING for parser - just use it as:
parse_from_file('path_to_file', parser_settings={'log_level': logging.WARNING}). For issue: https://github.com/xnuinside/simple-ddl-parser/issues/160

## [0.27.0] - 2022-08-07

2. Added flag to DDLParser(.., normalize_names=True) that change output of parser:
if flag is True (default 'False') then all identifiers will be returned without '[', '"' and other delimiters that used in different SQL dialects to separate custom names from reserved words & statements.
For example, if flag set 'True' and you pass this input:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TO_Requests](
    [Request_ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [user_id] [int]

In output you will have names like 'dbo' and 'TO_Requests', not '[dbo]' and '[TO_Requests]'.
